**Unit 3: Recruitment, Selection, and Retainment** <span id="3"></span> 
**In this unit, we will review different ways of screening and selecting
employees. This evaluation process generally takes the form of an
interview or a resume, but there are other ways of conducting the
process. The focus of this unit will be the understanding the use of
personnel assessments in the hiring process. *  
  
 *It should be noted that many of the evaluation techniques that
companies use when evaluating employees stem from psychological research
methodology or statistical theory. If you are unfamiliar with either of
these topics, some of these concepts may seem daunting or discouragingly
complex. For this reason, it may be helpful to review or refer to
supplemental materials on these topics as you progress through this
unit. We will begin by discussing the purpose of personnel assessments
and the legal issues around using them. **
