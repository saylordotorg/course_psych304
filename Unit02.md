**Unit 2: Job Analysis and Evaluation** <span id="2"></span> 
**An individual analyzes a job or career (i.e. performs “job analysis”)
by identifying the components and requirements of that job and
determining whether he will be able to fulfill his own desires and
exercise his unique abilities in that position. Employers, on the other
hand, use job analysis in order to accurately describe job
responsibilities and outline the attributes and skills best suited to
their performance. If employers are incompetent with job analysis, they
will likely face problems with personnel recruitment, having implemented
standards that are either too low or too high. This unit will discuss
these matters in greater detail.**
