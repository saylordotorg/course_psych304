**Unit 1: An Introduction to Industrial/Organizational Psychology**
<span id="1"></span> 
**Industrial and Organizational Psychology studies the psychology of
people in the workplace. As you will learn in this unit, psychology can
teach us how our workplace functions and why it functions as it does. It
is important to note, however, that I/O psychology is not simply the
psychology of business. While the two areas certainly overlap, I/O deals
with the “human” aspect of the working environment (i.e. the
interactions and factors that affect people), not the broader aspects of
running a business or organization. In this unit, we will introduce
different areas of I/O psychology and discuss ways in which psychology
can teach us about our workplace. Though we will only briefly touch upon
several different subjects in this unit, we will expand upon them later
in this course. **
