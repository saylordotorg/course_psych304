**Unit 7: Group Behavior and Conflict/Work Teams** <span id="7"></span> 
*Since the workplace typically requires employees to work and interact
with people in group settings, it is important to examine how
individuals behave when in groups and how a group behaves as a whole.
Much of this research has grown out of Social Psychology, a subfield of
psychology that explores how societies and groups affect individuals and
vice versa. As with the previous unit, however, you will notice that
certain observations that may hold true in other settings are not
applicable to workplace settings. For example, psychologists tend to
view groups as individuals who hold similar beliefs, share similar
ideas, and voluntarily choose to get together to form a group. In the
workplace, this is not necessarily the case. Frequently, the only thing
that employees have in common with one another is their employer. We
will take this observation into consideration as we study the ways in
which groups interact with each other and individuals interact in groups
within the workplace. We will also take a look at how conflicts within
groups can cause problems in a workplace setting.*
