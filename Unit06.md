**Unit 6: Leadership** <span id="6"></span> 
*Leadership is an important trait in the workplace, as partly evidenced
by the myriad books and seminars available to individuals interested in
honing and developing their leadership skills. Leadership, however, is a
complicated trait. Even those with great leadership abilities may not
demonstrate their skills in every situation under the sun *– *they often
demonstrate their leadership talents in unanticipated interactions with
others. In this unit, we will not only review why and how leadership is
important, but identify the characteristics associated with individuals
who tend to be leaders. Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence will
also be explained. Emotional Intelligence has become far more important
than just productivity.*
