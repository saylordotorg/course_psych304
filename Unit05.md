**Unit 5: Employee Motivation, Satisfaction, and Commitment** <span
id="5"></span> 
*In previous units, we have gone over material that is primarily
applicable to the workplace setting. While this unit will continue to
look at issues related to the workplace, the information we will cover
and the conclusions we will draw will be more readily generalizable to
people in a number of different settings.*  
  
 *This unit will discuss the concepts of motivation, satisfaction, and
commitment. You will find that although these concepts are (as earlier
noted) widely applicable to a variety of circumstances, they have some
interesting nuances when studied in the workplace. We will address these
nuances, exploring the general research trends that they contradict. We
will also consider motivation, satisfaction, and commitment from both
employee and employer perspectives.*
