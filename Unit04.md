**Unit 4: Evaluating Work Performance** <span id="4"></span> 
**In the previous unit, we discussed various methods of evaluating work
performance. This may seem like a straightforward task, but as this unit
will demonstrate, there are a number of factors that must be considered,
including what to do with the information that employee evaluations
collect. How to deliver the information, as well as the succession
planning and pay structure will be covered. These considerations can
become even more complicated when you imagine that you are evaluating
not just one employee but dozens or even hundreds of employees. This
unit will present strategies for these situations.**
