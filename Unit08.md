**Unit 8: Work-Family Balance** <span id="8"></span> 
*The final unit on the course will examine how workers and employers are
both managing work-family balance in an effort to keep health costs down
and productivity up. The current statistics show that there is more of a
focus on work-family balance than there ever has been in the workplace.
Work schedules are changing and becoming more and more flexible. Part of
finding the balance for employees is taking a look at human factors and
ergonomics and how these affect satisfaction, commitment, and the bottom
line.*
